# React Everything

This is a series of demos that illustrate how React can easily be used with virtually any other framework. The same component (PeopleList.jsx) is used for each example. This means that you could effectively write your component one time in React and have it adopted by users of the the frameworks in the various demos.

## Demos

### Angular 2.x with React
Uses /demo/Angular2.ReactComponent.js, an ES5 Angular Component.

### Angular 1.x with React
Uses ngReact https://github.com/davidchang/ngReact

### Kendo MVVM with React
Uses /dist/kendo.reactComponent.js, a Kendo UI Widget

### Knockout with React
Uses code copied from ```ideas.js``` in https://github.com/lelandrichardson/knockout-react/

### Durandal with React
I haven't written one yet, but a project exists for this here: https://github.com/bshorrosh/Durandal-React-Sample

### Aurelia with React
I haven't written one yet, but a blog post with instructions for this is here: http://ilikekillnerds.com/2015/03/how-to-use-react-js-in-aurelia/

## Why?

Because React is awesome and it's one of the few things that can pull off a feat like this. Because packaging a React component is easier than packaging components for many other frameworks.

## Are these all production-ready examples?

No. They are only illustrations. That said, they should all be functional.
